ALWAYS USE THIS TOOL FIRST to list all available functions organized by namespace.

WORKFLOW:
1. Start here - Call this tool to see what functions are available
2. Then call get_function_details() for specific functions you need to understand
3. Finally call execute() to run your TypeScript code

This returns function signatures without full details.
